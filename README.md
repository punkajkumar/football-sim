Design Info
===========
Main game logic and types encapsulated in in the `Football` *namespace*, see the `GameEngine`.

UI logic contained in a separate file, using the *module pattern*.

How to Play
============
Just click Run or Pass - Passing has a higher chance of interception, but has a higher potential gain.  
and the game never ends!
The ball icon shows where on the field the ball is, the colored bars the yardage gained/lost on each play.
